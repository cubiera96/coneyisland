    <h1><center> Coney Island Residents Fight Back To Fix Boardwalk </center></h1>
    <h3><center> By Cheyenne R. Ubiera </center></h3>
<p> Ramon Guadalupe knows to watch his step when he goes out for his morning jog on the Coney Island Boardwalk. Dodging the uneven planks and loose nails has become a part of his daily routine and the lifelong resident is calling for something to be done.</p>
 <p> He voiced his concerns at the community board meeting on Wednesday, discussing the deteriorating state of the boardwalk and the lack of urgency from the Parks Department. Guadalupe ended his speech by pressuring District Manager Eddie Mark, and the rest of the boardmembers, to make the boardwalk their top priority.</p>
 <p><q>Coney Island is constantly spoken to and taught a lesson,</q> Guadalupe said in an interview. <q>They’re never included in the lesson</q>
  </p>

    <p> The boardwalk’s conditions aren’t a new issue for Coney.
      It has been an issue even before Hurrican Sandy damaged parts of the boardwalk and pier back in 2012.  <br>It has been a recurring issue for many years as residents blame the Parks Department for repairs not getting done.</br>

<p>According to Guadalupe, after Sandy, the boardwalk became largely neglected and it is mostly due, in part, by the Parks Department’s lack of communication with the community.</p>

<p><q>The community wants to come out and help,</q> said Guadalupe.</p>

        <p> Guadalupe isn’t alone in his anger, he runs a Facebook group <q>Concerned Residents for a Safer Boardwalk</q> where over 120 members post pictures and voice their opinions over the lack of care being given to the West End side of the boardwalk in comparison to the Amusement District.

<br>One member is Kouichi Shirayanagi who, despite only living in Coney Island for 18 months, takes his son out on the boardwalk every day and is highly aware of its disrepair. His anger is geared towards the heavy volume of vehicle traffic on the boardwalk which all comes from the city.</br>

            <p> The traffic constantly wears down and damages the boardwalk, says Shirayanagi and the only parts that get routinely fixed are the ones with the most tourists.

<br>These sentiments were echoed by the community which pressured the city to ban any unauthorized vehicles on both the boardwalk and beach. </br>However, vans and trucks
from the Parks Department still drive by making many residents worry about how they are causing boardwalk planks to buckle underneath their weight.
<br><q>They think they’re doing a good job,</q> said Shirayanagi about the Parks Department. <q>But it’s their vehicles doing most of the damage.</q></br>

Despite the silence from the city, Guadalupe refuses to back down in his fight. He plans on organizing with other residents to hold a demonstration on the boardwalk where people can state their concerns in public.


<br>When people talk about Coney Island, it is always about the rides and other attractions, says Guadalupe. When it comes to funding and laws

being made, the residents of the West End are ignored.</br>

<q>There’s a lot to be known here,</q> said Guadalupe. <q>It’s not just a fight for the boardwalk, it’s a fight for power.</q>
